**Writeup**
1. I2C uses addresses and a shared bus, which means connecting other devices to the wires is much easier and faster. SPI lacks in the way that it is limited to the amount of master and slave devices, whereas I2C can use multiple slaves and masters. UART is a basic communication system, it is weak in the sense that it is only suitable for communication between two devices, which means that additional communication devices may overwhelm it. 
2. I2C uses two pins, SCL and SDA, one is a clock and one is serial data. 
3. A master is a device that controls multiple other deivces, whereas a slave is a device that is controlled by the master device.
