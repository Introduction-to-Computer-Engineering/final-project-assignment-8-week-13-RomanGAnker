**Oscilloscope Part 1**

**PWM**

</br > In this video, PWM pulses are being emitted and captured on the oscilloscope. I was able to emit the PWM waves through creating a line of code on the microbit. 
##**Loop**##

In this task, I used code to create a loop that varied the duty cycle between 5% and 95 % (In increments of 5%). 
**Writeup**
1. I2C uses addresses and a shared bus, which means connecting other devices to the wires is much easier and faster. SPI lacks in the way that it is limited to the amount of master and slave devices and the number of pins it needs to function, whereas I2C can use multiple slaves and masters. UART is a basic communication system, it is weak in the sense that it is only suitable for communication between two devices, which means that additional communication devices may overwhelm it. 
2. I2C uses two pins, SCL and SDA, one is a clock and one is a data signal. 
3. A master is a device that controls multiple other deivces, whereas a slave is a device that is controlled by the master device. 
4. The difference between the two protocol systems is relatively complex, The I2C communication has much more demanding protocol to follow than the UART and SPI. I2C protocol revolves around a system of the SCL and SDA lines switching between each other going high and low. 
The most appropriate trigger for capturing an I2C frame on the oscilloscope is using "single" to capture a single frame on the readings. It is very easy to visualize the data when you can decipher between individual frames.
